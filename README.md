# AngioData : A Novel Open Dataset of Coronary Artery Keyframes Extracted via Deep Learning

This is the official repository for the paper "AngioData : A Novel Open Dataset of Coronary Artery Keyframes Extracted via Deep Learning" submited in Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research.
.

I have to say that this code was inspired from <a href="URL_du_lien">https://github.com/RGivisiez/Blood-Vessel-Segmentation</a>

I made some of the following changes:

- Load images has been adapted to the structure of our dataset;
- We trained the U-net model on a dataset given from ;
- The test is done on our personal dataset to produce the frame masks (Ground Truth).

# usefulness :

This project can be used to automatically generate groundtruths of medical images. It was tested on a sample of coronary frames extracted from angiographic videos. Then it offers keyframes extraction from each video.

The project will be useful to automatically manage a large dataset ensuring better performance.

In this work, we have applied the method of filters on the frames for extraction of keyframes.

# Environment
Python, Keras, Kaggle cloud

# Dataset
The full dataset was collected from exams performed by a single catheterization laboratory during the period between January 2018 and December 2021.
Dataset consisted of 3159 angiographic study: a total of 37209 coronary angiograms was extracted. We used a sample of 45 angiograms to extract a total of
1434 frames of size 512 x 512 pixels.
A sample of the dataset is put in the "oneSampleCoro" section above.
All zipped dataset is put in the "all_dataSet_deep" section above.

# Model
The used model is U-net from @https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597 

# Trained models
Section Models contains models traindes with 150, 200 and 300 epochs.
